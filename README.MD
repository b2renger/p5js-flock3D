TODO :

* parameters (number of boids, shape drawn, size of the box)
* find orientation of a boid (to draw a cone with the correct heading)
* build a 3D audio engine, with a fixed number of voices polyphonic synth and some kind of LOD mechanism to ease on the cpu.
* better cam control, use accel on smartphone for a vr-like experience.
